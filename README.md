Python scripts\\

Hugoniot_Up_Us_P_rho.py: This calculates the Hugoniot relationships for (Mg,Fe)O (Figure 2a, 2b)
Us_Reflectivity.py: This calcualtes the reationship between the shock velocity and reflectivity (Figure 3a)
Us_Temperature.py: This calcualtes the reationship between the shock velocity and temperature (Figure 3b)
Us_electrical_conductivity.py: This calcualtes the reationship between the shock velocity and DC conductivity (Figure 3c)
Z_values.py: This calcualtes the reationship between the shock velocity and Z values (Supplementary Figure 2)
sigma_model.py: This calcualtes the electrical conductivity model (Supplementary Figure 3)

Data folders\\

Hugoniot/: This stores data for Hugoniot relation plots (used in Figure 2a, 2b)
MgFeO_shock_data/: This stores data for reflectivity, temperature, DC conductivity, Z values, and conductivity models (Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, Supplementary Figure 2 and Figure 3)
phase/: This stores data phase data files (used in Figure 3b)

Note\\

LLNL's AnalyzeVISAR code was used to analyze the VISAR and SOP data.
